Control Statement : 

Looping statement :

		for loop 
            nested for 

		while loop

		do-while loop
for loop :
  
      for(initilization ; condition;iteration){

		Action

}

initilization : -> Starting point

condition : end point

iteration : flow 
	forward  -> increment  -> ++
	backward -> decrement  -> --


while loop : 


	Entry Level Condition Checking

do-while loop: 

	Exit Level Condition Checking


Selection Statement (or) condition statement : 

		if -->it should print if the condition is true.

		elseif -->it is performed after the if statement.

		else -->it should print if if condition is true.

		switch -->more than a condition.



=   -> initilization

==  -> condition checking

Logical Operators : 

&& -> Both Conditions must be Satisfied  (Logical AND)

|| -> either one condition   (logical OR )



Jumping Statement : 


break  -> it will exit from the loop


continue -> it will skip the particular iteration



Pre-Increment  ->

		++ variableName    -> 1+(variableValue)


Post-Increment  ->     
                
                variableName++    -> (variableValue)+1

`	        In step it will add the value
